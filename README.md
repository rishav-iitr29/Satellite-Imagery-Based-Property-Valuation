# Satellite-Imagery-Based-Property-Valuation
### Overview

This project explores whether satellite imagery provides additional predictive signal beyond traditional tabular features for residential property valuation. Using a combination of structured housing attributes and overhead satellite images, we build and evaluate multimodal regression models to predict house prices.  
The primary goal is not only accuracy, but also interpretability — understanding what visual cues (e.g., greenery, water proximity, neighborhood layout) influence model predictions.
